## Repository

DevBook is a social development environment for front-end designers and developers.
A project editor that supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where you can show off your work, build test cases to learn and debug, and find inspiration .

## Join Here

Join us to build a real-time platform which is built drawing inspiration from CodePen like code editor but with advance features and better enhancements. There are already some extra features like parentheses adding, code folding, auto-tag complete, linting features, auto-saving your previous code in local storage in this some of which you'll not find in other similar code editors.
We are planning to build our own code editor that will support HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript/TypeScript as of now. But the bigger vision is to implement frameworks, libraries like React, Angular, Vue etc also in future.

### Node

- #### Node installation on Windows

  Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer.
  Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).

- #### Node installation on Ubuntu

  You can install nodejs and npm easily with apt install, just run the following commands.

      $ sudo apt install nodejs
      $ sudo apt install npm

- #### Other Operating Systems
  You can find more information about the installation on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and the [official NPM website](https://npmjs.org/).

If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.

    $ node --version
    v8.11.3

    $ npm --version
    6.1.0

If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! Cool right? After running the following command, just open again the command line and be happy.

    $ npm install npm -g
